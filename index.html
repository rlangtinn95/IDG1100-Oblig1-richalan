<h3>24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at” +

        the line will look like this: "task * 17 11 * echo "task scheduled at $(date)" >> /home/example1.txt
        6. navigate to /home, and touch a file named example1.txt
        7. start the cron service: service cron start
        8. cat the example1.txt file to view the output</p>
<h3>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
    The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
    chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
    the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
    the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
    changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
    menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
